This project is based on Remote Access control , Its just an old school trick displayed with the help of these python scripts where a person can remotely access someone pc/laptop
With the help of these two files 

**Client** -> for the controlled one 
**Server** -> for the controller 

Right now this script is not dynamic but for doing that, We have to purchase our own private ip.

**Procedure : **
 For implementing this old school hacking 
 Just customise client and server script with your ip 
 Then what you have to do is just plant the file in someone's laptop and execute it 
 
 
 Requirements :
  1) Python installed
  2) requests library
